Required zen-cart configuration settings 
----------------------------------------
* When using ZenMagick themes, the missing page check must be disabled using zen-cart
  admin (Configuration -> My Store: 'Missing Page Check'). 

Additional configuration
------------------------
This release includes a sample ZenMagick config file named local.php.in. If required,
rename to local.php and uncomment the settings you need.
To learn more about available settings, check zenmagick/core/settings/defaults.php.
A lot of the settings can be configured via the admin interface, some are ZenMagick
specific and require to use local.php.
Also, keep in mind that you can also create a local.php file in your theme's extra folder
if you are using multiple themes and need theme specific configuration.

zencart template files
----------------------
To avoid confusion, unsued zencart template files are not included as individual files. If, for some
reason, you need the original zencart template files, you'll find them in zc_install/optional/templates.zip
