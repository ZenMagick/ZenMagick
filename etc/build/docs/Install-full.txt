Installing ZenMagick
====================
Version: ${zenmagick.version}


1. Copy/Upload Files
====================

Upload all included files into your document root on the server. If you are
using a management console like Plesk or similar you can also upload the zip
and unpack on the server using the management consoles file manager.


2. Create a database
====================

Prior to running the installation wizard you need to create a database to be used
by ZenMagick.


3. Install
==========

Open a browser and browse your site. You should see a welcome page with directions as to how
to actually install and set up ZenMagick.


4. Troubleshooting
==================
There are a few reasons why the patches might not work as expected. If that 
is the case you may not see the ZenMagick menu, but only a menu item ZenMagick 
Installation under the Tools menu. Selecting that, you will see ZenMagick's installation 
options and error messages detailing why the patches did not work.

Please check the wiki [http://wiki.zenmagick.org/] section about troubleshooting.
You may also consult the forum [http://forum.zenmagick.org/] for similar topics or ask for help.

Required zen-cart configuration settings 
----------------------------------------
* When using ZenMagick themes, the missing page check must be disabled using zen-cart
  admin (Configuration -> My Store: 'Missing Page Check'). 

Additional configuration
------------------------
This release includes a sample ZenMagick config file named local.php.in. If required,
rename to local.php and uncomment the settings you need.
To learn more about available settings, check zenmagick/core/settings/defaults.php.
A lot of the settings can be configured via the admin interface, some are ZenMagick
specific and require to use local.php.
Also, keep in mind that you can also create a local.php file in your theme's extra folder
if you are using multiple themes and need theme specific configuration.
