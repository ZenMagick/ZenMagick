Installing ZenMagick into an existing Zen Cart installation
===========================================================
Version: ${zenmagick.version}


1. Copy/Upload Files
====================

Unpack the downloaded archive into your zen-cart installation folder. If you 
upgrade from a previous version, backup your files before installing any updates.

It is recommended to remove everything from the zenmagick folder, except for 
your theme directory and local.php file before installing a new version. This 
helps to avoid having obsolete files staying around.


2. Configuration
================

2.1 ZenMagick Patches
---------------------
Even though ZenMagick does not contain modified zen-cart files, it requires 
changes to zen-cart files in order to work properly. ZenMagick contains a set 
of patches to automatically perform those modifications.

If you are installing ZenMagick for the first time, those patches will need to be
run by visiting http://[YOUR DOMAIN]/zenmagick/apps/admin/web/upgrade.php

NOTE: If you are installing a full build these patches are already applied to the included
zen cart files.

As an alternative pre-patched versions of all affected zencart files are included in a zip file
in the etc folder.


2.2 Troubleshooting
-------------------

Please check the wiki [http://wiki.zenmagick.org/] section about troubleshooting.
You may also consult the forum [http://forum.zenmagick.org/] for similar topics or ask for help.

2.3 Required zen-cart configuration settings 
--------------------------------------------
* When using ZenMagick themes, the missing page check must be disabled using zen-cart
  admin (Configuration -> My Store: 'Missing Page Check'). 

2.4 Additional configuration
----------------------------
This release includes a sample ZenMagick config file named local.php.in. If required,
rename to local.php and uncomment the settings you need.
To learn more about available settings, check zenmagick/core/settings/defaults.php.
A lot of the settings can be configured via the admin interface, some are ZenMagick
specific and require to use local.php.
Also, keep in mind that you can also create a local.php file in your theme's extra folder
if you are using multiple themes and need theme specific configuration.
