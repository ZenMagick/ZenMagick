Installing ZenMagick admin
==========================

ZenMagick admin is the standalone version of the admin UI that comes with ZenMagick. it can be installed beside
any Zen Cart installation.


1. Copy/Upload Files
====================

Upload all included files into your zencart installation folder. If you are
using a management console like Plesk or similar you can also upload the zip
and unpack on the server using the management consoles file manager.


2. Install
==========

2.1 Run SQL scripts
-------------------
ZenMagick admin requires a couple additional database tables. The following scripts need to be run
via the Zen Cart SQL Patch tool:

* zmadmin/shared/etc/sql/mysql/admin_prefs_install.sql
* zmadmin/shared/etc/sql/mysql/admin_roles_install.sql

NOTE: Corresponding un-install scripts are located in the same folder.

2.2 Optional steps for Zen Cart installations with renamed admin folder
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have renamed your admin folder (as per Zen Cart recommendation), you will need to manually
edit the file 'zmadmin/apps/admin/web/index.php'

Find this line: 

  define('ZC_ADMIN_NAME', 'admin');

and change admin to whatever the name of your admin folder.


3. Using ZenMagick admin
========================

Once installed, there will be a new menu item Tools = ZenMagick Admin that will let you log in into the 
ZenMagick admin application.

Alternatively, open a browser and browse to http://[YOUR_DOMAIN]/zmadmin/apps/admin/web/

If all is well you should see the ZenMagick admin login page. Login details are shared with Zen Cart,
so just login using your normal admin credentials.

NOTE: If your Zen Cart installation is not in the document root but in a subfolder the URL will look like this:
http://[YOUR_DOMAIN]/[ZENCART_FOLDER]/zmadmin/apps/admin/web/
