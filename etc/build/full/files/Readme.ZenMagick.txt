 ZenMagick ${zenmagick.version} - Zen Cart evolved!
===============================================

Welcome to ZenMagick! 

First off, a few useful URLs that should help make your life easier:
* Installation: http://wiki.zenmagick.org/index.php/Installation
* Forum: http://forum.zenmagick.org/

ZenMagick is based on Zen Cart(tm). For this reason, the installation of ZenMagick (full-release) is based on the traditional
Zen Cart installation process.

On first browsing your uploaded store you should be faced with the offer to install. Following the installation screens should
get your store installed in a few moments.

Once that installation process is finished your store is almost ready to go. Typical next steps would be:
* Customize the look & feel.
* Create categories.
* Add products.
* Configure zones, tax, shipping and payment options
