<h3>Welcome to your new ZenMagick powered online store!</h3>

<p>This is the sample welcome text included in the default theme. The HTML is stored in 
<code>zenmagick/themes/default/lang/english/static/main_page.php</code>.</p>

<p>You can quickly edit this content via Admin-&gt;ZenMagick-&gt;Static Page Editor by selecting <code>main_page</code> from the file pulldown.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: It is not recommended to modify the default files as they might get overwritten by subsequent updates.</strong></p>

<p>Instead you are encouraged to create your own theme (via ZenMagick-&gt;Theme Builder) and create static pages there as required.</p> </div>
