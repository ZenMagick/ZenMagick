1) Copy/Upload Files

Unpack the downloaded archive into your zen-cart installation folder. If you 
upgrade from a previous version, backup your files before installing any updates.

It is recommended to remove everything from the zenmagick folder, except for 
your theme directory and local.php file before installing a new version. This 
helps to avoid having obsolete files staying around.


2) Updating admin

ZenMagick contains files that need to be added to the zen-cart admin directory. 
If you have renamed your admin directory as recommened by zen-cart (obscurity 
rather than security), you have two options:

* Move the contents of the ZenMagick admin folder manually into your renamed 
  admin directory
* Extract the release locally, rename the extracted admin folder, zip everything 
  up again and use the new zip file for installation. 

3) Configuration
3.1) ZenMagick Patches
Even though ZenMagick does not contain modified zen-cart files, it requires 
changes to zen-cart files in order to work properly. ZenMagick contains a set 
of patches to automatically perform those modifications.

If you are installing ZenMagick for the first time, those patches will need to be 
run the first time you login to zen-cart admin. A new menu item 'ZenMagic Installation'
should be under Tools.

3.2) Troubleshooting
There are a number of reasons why the patches might not work as expected. If that 
is the case you may not see the ZenMagick menu, but only a menu item ZenMagick 
Installation under the Tools menu. Selecting that you will see ZenMagick's installation 
options and error messages detailing why the patches did not work.

Please check the wiki section about Troubleshooting if you can't get things to work.
You may also consult the forums for similar topics or ask for help.

3.3) Required zen-cart configuration settings 

* When using ZenMagick themes, the missing page check must be disabled using zen-cart
  admin (Configuration -> My Store: 'Missing Page Check').
