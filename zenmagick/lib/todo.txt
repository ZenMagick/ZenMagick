- map/set new settings


far future:
- make ZMView generic, let it look at ?layouts? / ?views? 
  * allow subfolder in view name (as now?), remove subfolder property, etc.
  * FLAG view content in layout via text replacement @VIEW_CONTENT@ or PHP?
- property to either:
  * use URL parameter: action=...
  * use simple SEO: index.php/action/sub/whatever
  * use advanced SEO: ../action/sub/whatever
  * use custom SEO: SEO plugin handler
  * allow plugins in any combination above
- default toolbox with url/form support
- build in scaffolding (if it has to be...)

shared folder here: share code across all apps

how:
- to allow views to implement full response (skipping layout)
- to implement theme inheritance (theme being apps?) - allow default/base app? implement on top of app??
- to abuse views for email or other content generation: allow getView ZMUrlMapping to be called directly - still would need
  subclass to allow to select text/html or other specific options?
- to implement plugins
- to implement test cases - include support in lib; core;? - split core/mvc and app tests
- loader: lib, apps, global plugins?, app plugins?
