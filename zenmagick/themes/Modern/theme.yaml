# changes:
#
# - change name, author and description
# - remove demo about us controller
# - change bullet_cat.gif position to align better with multi level catalogs: .4em left
# - fix invalid " in shopping_cart.php: style="text-align: left""
# - fix CSS: #productMainImage contains width: without value
# - changed header to not use zen_xxx() functions
# - removed the STORE_STATUS check in header.php - none of the themes doe this and this is not officially supported
# - removed demo and demo_request views
# - removed about_us view (empty except for h1)
# - removed stativ view (no difference in function to default)
# - removed custom static/define page content files: about_us.php, contact_us.php
# - removed lang/english/l10n.php - looks like copy from demo theme
# - removed empty lang/english/images folder
# - removed lang folder
# - in header.php: removed line: <?php ZMLoader::make('ToolboxHtml'); ?> - this doesn't make sense, $html is automatically set up
#   and the correct one too, just with the custom class somewhere in the extra folder (or subfolder of that)
# - change use of HTTP_SERVER.DIR_WS_CATALOG to $net->url(FILENAME_DEFAULT)
# - remove wrongly placed content/views/options.php
# - moved content/images/ri_template.jpg to themes/Modern/preview.jpg
# - add CSS rule for sb_information to make links wrap
# - removed code to generate RHS column
# - add custom theme.css with rules to make other sideboxes look better
# - also add code to default_layout.php to add the footer div to not customized boxes
# - explicitely set the leftBoxContainer width to 220px to avoid the centre column wrapping
# - !added price class to default theme sidebox prices


# Notes:
# - I think with all those classes and ids, there is almost no justification for inline styles as used in a few places
# - style: element names in CSS rules should be lower case
# - only three sideboxes adapted; using default sideboxes causes wrapping of centre column underneath the left column
# - rihgt hand side column could be disabled via theme code - admin r/l hand side column options are not theme specific
# - header uses zen_xxx code for the search box: not good
# - ZenMagick does not use the advanced_search_results url any more; there is a search and advanced_search
# - header also uses zen-cart style defines for translatable text
# - header also uses if (STORE_STATUS == '0') { - instead the corresponding ZenMagick setting should be used
# - in ZenMagick, there is a wrapper around $_SESSION, so using $_SESSION directly is considered bad
#   if ($_SESSION['customer_id'])  should be: if ($request->isRegistered()) 
# - in addition to the above, there are: if ($request->isAnonymous()) and: if ($request->isGuest())
#   NOTE: if a user is guest, logoff is available, the account page not!
# - not sure if the search was tested, but the ZenMagick search results page doesn't look that flash
# - maybe the code for the right hand side column should be removed completely in default_layout.php
