<p>Keywords may be separated by <em>and</em> and/or <em>or</em> statements for greater control of the search results.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="example">Microsoft <em>and</em> mouse</span> would generate a result set that contain both words.
   However, for <span class="example">mouse <em>or</em> keyboard</span>, the result set returned would contain both or either words.</p>

<p>Exact matches can be searched for by enclosing keywords in double-quotes.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="example">"notebook computer"</span> would generate a result set which match the exact string.</p>

<p>Brackets can be used for further control on the result set.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="example">Microsoft <em>and</em> (keyboard <em>or</em> mouse <em>or</em> "visual basic")</span>.</p>
