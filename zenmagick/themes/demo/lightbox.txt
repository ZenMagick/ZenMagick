The lightbox demo will work with and without ImageHandler2.

If you move the images or you have renamed the zenmagick folder, 
there are two places to adjust image names:

1) demo/content/css/product_info.css
CSS image names need to be relative to the location of the CSS file.

2) demo/content/lightbox/lightbox.js
Filenames here are relative to the zen-cart folder (usually they will
start with zenmagick/themes/..).
