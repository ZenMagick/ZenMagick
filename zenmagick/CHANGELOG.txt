  code) plus the settings 'isEnablePHPBBLinks'

- added ZMShippingMethod::getShippingId() and made zm_shipping_id(..)

  discount calculations (eg. Save: 15.3% for one decimal point)
- add new constants for different sale types

- fix broken text confirmation email if no shipping address exists (virtual

- removed obsolete function zm_quote(..)

	registration
	REGISTERED: fully registered user
- update phppdoc to use boolean rather than just bool

  core/html/default/products.php

  method mappings; this allows to map methods for recursively processed

  (plus any number of code implementing all that)
- disable validation of billing address list selection during checkout
- auto select shipping/billing address in list if only one address

  theme specific
- removed Ultimate SEO2.x rewrite rules from the release .htaccess file; the

  ZMRequest::getParameter(...)

  see ZMPlugin::addMenuItem(...) for details

- fixed a few typos in RSS classes

  taking a copy; removed ZMShoppingCart::refresh()
- changed fopen call in lastRSS.php to @fopen to avoid ugly error stacks if
  behind a firewall...
- level of loader support for plugins is now depending on the configured
  loader support flag for each plugin. The flag also controlls core.php
	inclusion. Valid flags are:
	NONE   = no loader support; no core.php support
	PLUGIN = no additional loader support; plugin class will be added to
	         core.php
	ALL    = full loader support; all .php files will be included in core.php
- added basic support to add pretty link rules for custom URLs
- allow plugin admin pages to be generated as either simple contents or as
  part or a ZMPluginPage instance
	In other words, the function passed into ZMPlugin::addMenuIten(..) either
	generates simple HTML output, or no output at all but returns a ZMPluginPage
	instance containing the contents
- extract Ultimate SEO 2.x code into separate plugin
- Existing Ultimate SEO files may be removed using the install cleanup option;
  this needs to be done *before* installing the new zm_useo2 plugin

  than playing dead

- fixed #1740306: php warning when empty search result

  the init_templates.php override files as ZM_ROOT is not yet defined at that
  point
- disable POST handling when 'isEnableZenMagick' is false
- do not run zen-cart fixes (zc_fixes.php) if not using themes
  ('isEnableZenMagick'); this will break POST handling for some zen-cart pages
- allow category prev/next links to be secure if the page is secure
- fixed #1741055: nonssl links in order history
- added setting 'zmLogFilename', which, if set will be used to log ZenMagick log
  entries; default is null to use the default log file (usually the httpd

  custom error handler will be used to log **all** PHP messages in the custom
  logfile
- fixed invalid variable name in whos_online.php
- fixed missing order by SQL for new products (ZMProducts)

  update and address) and also adjust validation accordingly
- make update account work without dob

  $zm_addressList, as the name clashes with the ZMAddresses service instance;
	this requires to update address_book.php
- changed the id of the maine table in address.php from address to newaddress;
  there are corresponding changes to the CSS; the name clashes with the id of
	the address form element
- added list of selectable addresses for change shipping/biling address

  countryId

- added new global $zm_validator instance for central validation config (this
  will be used for server side validation, too)
- added new all-in-one ZMValidator::insertJSValidation($id) method
- added extra/valdation.php to default theme which now contains all
  validations
- modified all views that use JS validation to use the new validation code
- added new setting 'isAutoJSValidation' which is on by default; zm_form and
  zm_secure_form will automatically add JS validation code if it exists;
	this means all required is to set up validation rules and create the form
	using zm_form or zm_secure_form!
- make ZenMagick code fail gracefully *if* all patches are reverted *and* the
  zenmagick folder gets removed (I know this still leaves a trail of unused
	files, but still better than what we have now)
- added a meta tag: generator = ZenMagick [version] to the default_layout
- fixed server side validation code (has not been used until now)
- added new ZMSession class that acts as wrapper around $_SESSION in order to
  keep access to $_SESSION central and simple
- default and demo theme version now follow the main ZenMagick version number
- added ZMFieldMatchRule validation rule to validate new password and confirm
  password
- simplified the ZMMinRule setup, as name and min length are passed as
  parameter already (since we only use the min value, the format needed to be
	changed to %2$s to access the second format parameter rather than just using
	%s; please see http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.sprintf.php for more
	details)
- all regular access to $_GET and $_POST is now wrapped in zm_sanitize(..) calls
- refactored zm_db_value_list() into ZMDao::bindValueList(..)
- account subscriptions changed a bit to make the DAO more consistent - this
  required minor changes to a couple account views and controllers;
	basically ZMSubscriptions got dumped and all information moved into ZMAccount
- removed companyName from ZMAccount
- had to change email parameter handling - sorry! zen-cart values are now
  directly available under their respective names, for example 
	$INTRO_ORDER_NUMBER; zc_args does not exist any more.
- added code to handle forgotten password submits
- fix: getCompanyName() in create_account view needs to be called on
  zm_address rather than zm_account
- really fix dummy sidebox patch so no sidebox dummies are created for
  filenames including '.in.'
- renamed ZMModel::populateFromRequest() to populate($req)
- fixed some invalid settings
- changed the default message type from 'error' to 'msg'
- added forth inbuild message type 'success'
- messages now support references (ie; field names) like zen-cart does
- 'msg' and 'success' messages default to the same style in default and demo
  theme
- added zm_field_messages(..) and corresponding CSS rules to display field
  specific error messages - the demo theme login view is changed to illustrate
	thhis
- added code to ZMSession (and zm_redirect(..)) to save messages in the
  session if redirecting - this way it is transparent to the caller
- added submit handling for change account password
- fixed issue with ZMDateRule; format now defaults to UI_DATE_FORMAT if not
  set (null); this is related to the fact that i18n defines are set only
	*after* the validation rules are loaded and therefore UI_DATE_FORMAT is not
	yet available!
- added product_notification email template
- fixed DAO method bindValueList() for data types other than integer
- added a module base class ZMPlugin ('course it has to be named differently!)
- changed all code to use getDB() rather than $db_ directly
- renamed ZMDao and the dao package to ZMService and services, respectively to
  accomodate the fact that ZMDao was used in a broader sense than just DAO
- rewrite of the zco-notifier code to allow even easier subscriptions to
  zen-cart events (includes a new patch)
- added a (admittelty very basic) plugin admin page
- added ZMPluginFilter to allow plugins to modify the generated page contents
  before returning it to the client; NOTE: requires isEnableOB to be true!
- fixed/added getAmount() method to ZMOrderTotal and updated phpdoc -
  getValue() does actually return the string, not the (float) amount!
- renamed ZMOrderItem:getId() to ZMOrderItem:getProductId() as this is what it
  is; needs some changes to templates..
- renamed all desctructor methods ___desctructor, thus disabling them as they
  are currently all empty; this might break existing code as older versions do
	call parent::__desctruct()
- removed obsolete include of init.php in external.php
- added ZMUrlMapper to make response views configurable (via
  ZMController::findView(...))
- removed some .htaccess rules that do not seem to work too well with
  commercially hosted sites (missing images and CSS) ... I'll think about
	replacements once I am not so tired any more
- added console permanently to admin (rather than having it sitting in etc);
  you can always delete the file in admin if you do not want it...
- made 'isEnableOB' setting obsolete as we need that in order for plugins to
  be able to access the page content
- removed ZMCachedThemeView as this does not work with plugin page filters
- moved ZMView from the rp.uip to the rp package, ZMEmailView from 
  rp.uip.views.email to rp.uip.views;
- change ZMView::getPage() to ZMView::getName(); this requires changes to a
  couple theme files
- added new check to page cache check to disable caching of pages that contain
  messages
- ZMCurrencies does not rely on zen-carts global $currencies instance any more
- renamed ZMThemeView to ZMPageView
- make product comparison formk use GET rather than POST
- added contact_us POST handling; there is no support for the recipient
  dropdown; also, the email template will not work when using zen-cart request
	handling
- fixed ZMImageInfo and zm_absolute_href (thanks, Matt)
- went over all =& assignements to get rid of most PHP5 deprecated messages
- fixed wrong lookup of additional images (thanks again, Matt)

  (when setting the price prefix to '-') - and again, thanks Matt!

- disabled automatic patching while in the installation screen
- updated the copyright year in all comments (thanks for Ant's replaceregexp!)
- FWIW there is now an option to skip the strip phase generating core.php
  which makes reading the file easier (I was curious about the file size
	difference...)
- added file changelog (added/modified/removed); this is based on the actual
  difference between release .zip files rather than CVS, so it should be
	actually useful
- added setting to control which pages get SEO treatment
- removed unused rewrite rules from .htaccess file
- added new ZMZcoObserver as global observer of some zen-cart events where
  nothing else works

  NOTE: the gv_send_confirmation template changed as well
- created text chunks for cvv_help and search_help popup text
- moved l10n and i18n stuff into locale package
- split model package into sub-packages
- always load order status
- added gv_send and order_status email views; NOTE: some code might change as
  the data is not all ready to use yet (need to pull it out of zen-cart code)

- added getCategoryPath() method to ZMCategory

Release 0.7.0.1
- fix file patches that append empty lines to zen-cart files, thus creating
  leading empty lines in HTML output
- fix missing TOC in EZ pages
- added missing CSS for EZ pages TOC in demo theme
- fixed broken account notification view
- fixed wrong account notification checkbox names
- another fix for multi value request parameter in zm_href(..)
- includes zmConsole.php

Release 0.7.0
- added about page
- added optional PHP console; good for debuging, but a possible security issue,
  so it's distributed in the etc directory and needs to be copied manually into
  the zen-cart admin folder
- theme code refactoring
- moved getCurrencyId(), getLanguageId() and getLanguageName() from ZMRequest to ZMRuntime
- theme info will inherit default settings
- added zm_phpinfo() function that strips some of the original formatting
- removed unneccessary echo from eval(..) calls
- renamed ZMRuntime::getApplicationRoot() to getContext()
- ZMLoader::getStatic() now guarantees that local.php is the first item if it
  exists
- locale settings are now also inherited from the default theme
- changed default templates to use ZMDateRule to validate dates - the JS
  validation is now also more strict; this also means UI_DATE_FORMAT_VALIDATION
  is obsolete :)
- refactored generic date parsing code into zm_parse_date(..)
- excluded account, write and edit pages from page cache - this is a temp.
  solutions until I can come up with some proper config for this
- fix zm_is_empty for arrays was doing the oppositve of what is expected
- added better request dispatching code to allow for multiple theme switching
  => all ZenMagick globals are instantiated before, MetaTags and Crumbtrail
  may be overwritten with theme versions; same stays true for controller
  => switching is only supported in extra code, everything else is not defined
  => the switch will be done after *all* extra code has been loaded
- fixed categories code and underline current category in sidebox
- performance: moved cache check into init.php, thus cutting out more code
- fixed broken SQL patch
- added canUndo() metod to ZMInstallatinPatch
- added better file permission checks to core.php compressor
- added language to key for page cache
- use full names in patch messages
- fix ZMProduct::getDefaultCategory()
- fix features SQL for MySQL > 5.0.24
- fix some dao SQL issues with MySQL > 5.0.24
- fix category filter
- more phpdoc along the way
- changed JS validation code so validations skip empty fields; this means
  if a field is empty you won't get a message about invalid format
- added zm_htmlencode(..) wrapper to some more fields in product_info view and
  product images (alt/title)
- added .htaccess rules to support Ultimate SEO URLs
- integrated Ultimate SEO mod (based on version 2.103) into ZenMagick; this can
  be used as an alternative to ZenMagick's pretty links;
  There is also a new patch to enable/disable SEO - additional benefit,
  as there are no version specific zen-cart files required!
  SEO installer SQL has been updated and tested with MySQL 5.0.27
- added zen_href_link replacement that allows pretty links to work for
  redirects as well
- added dependsOn() method to installation patches
- added still missing product_reviews view
- the setting 'isEnableThemeDefaults' now controlls all aspects of theme
  defaults; this includes views, boxes, classes and l10n/i18n
- all default views now use zm_format_address(..) to format addresses
- reworked locale (l10n/i18n) handling, so using define(..) isn't a
  problem; this also means to split the theme loading from the request
  handling (which is actually good!) to be able to do theme loading during
  the init phase - otherwise zen-cart will have used up all the good defines :)
  This slightly changes the syntax in l10n and i18n files and breaks older
  themes. Advantage is that theme values are stored as variables and only
  once the final theme is determined are converted into defines thus allowing
  proper overwriting of values during theme switching and for fallback to
  default theme settings
  THIS BREAKS OLDER THEME LOCALE CODE
- fixed merge option in language tool work and added include default theme
  option
- added .htaccess files to restrict access to ZenMagick installation files
- extracted page caching strategy into separate function (default); THe
  strategy can be changed by configuring an alternative function by setting
  'pageCacheStrategyCallback'; signature is boolean callback()
- modified l10n.php and i18n.php in demo theme to illustrate the changes in
  locale handling;
- most patches now know how to undo
- changed patch so no sidebox dummies are created for filenames including '.in.'

  available or disabled
- changed all controller to use findView(..) to find the returned

- changed the default rss cache dir to be in line with the page cache settings

  permissions do not allow to add the ZenMagick menu, or under ZenMagick

  more
- zm_setting(..) now accepts a second parameter to set values; the return
  value is the old value or null
- upaded local.in.php to reflect this change; using $_ZM_SETTINGS is not
  deprecated - this might eventually disappear altogether...
- added getDefaultCategory() to ZMProduct; this will return either the master
  category or the first mapped category for the product
- fixed invalid db code in ZMProducts.php

  languages_id (disabled as default)

  product listings

- partly stripped ZMModel as the new validation code makes this obsolete (the
  implementation code will stay around until I find time to rewrite the update
  stuff)
- renamed rss and wordpress sideboxes to rss.in.php and wordpress.in.php,
  respectively. People using them should rename them in order to avoid
  overwriting them with the next update
