Release 0.7.0.1
- fix file patches that append empty lines to zen-cart files, thus creating
  leading empty lines in HTML output
- fix missing TOC in EZ pages
- added missing CSS for EZ pages TOC in demo theme
- fixed broken account notification view
- fixed wrong account notification checkbox names
- another fix for multi value request parameter in zm_href(..)

Release 0.7.0
- added about page
- added optional PHP console; good for debuging, but a possible security issue,
  so it's distributed in the etc directory and needs to be copied manually into
  the zen-cart admin folder
- theme code refactoring
- moved getCurrencyId(), getLanguageId() and getLanguageName() from ZMRequest to ZMRuntime
- theme info will inherit default settings
- added zm_phpinfo() function that strips some of the original formatting
- removed unneccessary echo from eval(..) calls
- renamed ZMRuntime::getApplicationRoot() to getContext()
- ZMLoader::getStatic() now guarantees that local.php is the first item if it
  exists
- locale settings are now also inherited from the default theme
- changed default templates to use ZMDateRule to validate dates - the JS
  validation is now also more strict; this also means UI_DATE_FORMAT_VALIDATION
  is obsolete :)
- refactored generic date parsing code into zm_parse_date(..)
- excluded account, write and edit pages from page cache - this is a temp.
  solutions until I can come up with some proper config for this
- fix zm_is_empty for arrays was doing the oppositve of what is expected
- added better request dispatching code to allow for multiple theme switching
  => all ZenMagick globals are instantiated before, MetaTags and Crumbtrail
  may be overwritten with theme versions; same stays true for controller
  => switching is only supported in extra code, everything else is not defined
  => the switch will be done after *all* extra code has been loaded
- fixed categories code and underline current category in sidebox
- performance: moved cache check into init.php, thus cutting out more code
- fixed broken SQL patch
- added canUndo() metod to ZMInstallatinPatch
- added better file permission checks to core.php compressor
- added language to key for page cache
- use full names in patch messages
- fix ZMProduct::getDefaultCategory()
- fix features SQL for MySQL > 5.0.24
- fix some dao SQL issues with MySQL > 5.0.24
- fix category filter
- more phpdoc along the way
- changed JS validation code so validations skip empty fields; this means
  if a field is empty you won't get a message about invalid format
- added zm_htmlencode(..) wrapper to some more fields in product_info view and
  product images (alt/title)
- added .htaccess rules to support Ultimate SEO URLs
- integrated Ultimate SEO mod (based on version 2.103) into ZenMagick; this can
  be used as an alternative to ZenMagick's pretty links;
  There is also a new patch to enable/disable SEO - additional benefit,
  as there are no version specific zen-cart files required!
  SEO installer SQL has been updated and tested with MySQL 5.0.27
- added zen_href_link replacement that allows pretty links to work for
  redirects as well
- added dependsOn() method to installation patches
- added still missing product_reviews view
- the setting 'isEnableThemeDefaults' now controlls all aspects of theme
  defaults; this includes views, boxes, classes and l10n/i18n
- all default views now use zm_format_address(..) to format addresses
- reworked locale (l10n/i18n) handling, so using define(..) isn't a
  problem; this also means to split the theme loading from the request
  handling (which is actually good!) to be able to do theme loading during
  the init phase - otherwise zen-cart will have used up all the good defines :)
  This slightly changes the syntax in l10n and i18n files and breaks older
  themes. Advantage is that theme values are stored as variables and only
  once the final theme is determined are converted into defines thus allowing
  proper overwriting of values during theme switching and for fallback to
  default theme settings
  THIS BREAKS OLDER THEME LOCALE CODE
- fixed merge option in language tool work and added include default theme
  option
- added .htaccess files to restrict access to ZenMagick installation files
- extracted page caching strategy into separate function (default); THe
  strategy can be changed by configuring an alternative function by setting
  'pageCacheStrategyCallback'; signature is bool callback()
- modified l10n.php and i18n.php in demo theme to illustrate the changes in
  locale handling;
- most patches now know how to undo
- changed patch so no sidebox dummies are created for filenames including '.in.'

Release 0.6.4:

- performance: enable standard output buffering if gzip compression not
  available or disabled
- changed all controller to use findView(..) to find the returned
  view object
- changed the default rss cache dir to be in line with the page cache settings
- included PEAR:Cache_Lite to distribution as cache driver
- performance: logging is now disabled in the default configuration

  individually;

Release 0.6.2:

  overwrite existing files any more!

  permissions do not allow to add the ZenMagick menu, or under ZenMagick
- return error view when ez page not found; same for product page and a few
  more
- zm_setting(..) now accepts a second parameter to set values; the return
  value is the old value or null
- upaded local.in.php to reflect this change; using $_ZM_SETTINGS is not
  deprecated - this might eventually disappear altogether...
- added getDefaultCategory() to ZMProduct; this will return either the master
  category or the first mapped category for the product
- fixed invalid db code in ZMProducts.php
- option to disable language support for ez-pages as zen-cart ignores the
  languages_id (disabled as default)
- Fix double slash '//' in pretty URLs

  product listings

- partly stripped ZMModel as the new validation code makes this obsolete (the
  implementation code will stay around until I find time to rewrite the update
  stuff)
- renamed rss and wordpress sideboxes to rss.in.php and wordpress.in.php,
  respectively. People using them should rename them in order to avoid
  overwriting them with the next update

- Excluding controller classes from being loaded on init - they (and possibly
