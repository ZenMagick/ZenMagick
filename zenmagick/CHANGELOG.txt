Release 0.8.2
- product_notifications.php should not use $zm_account
- ZMProductSorter:sort(..) - check that the given lsit is an array
- added ZMView::isValid(..)
- add defines for 5 log level
- implemented missing view check in ZMController; the view key for missing
  pages can be configured with 'missingPageId'; default is 'error'
- resorted the boostrap order to allow bootstrap.php to use zenmagick defines

Release 0.8.1
- added replacement method for ZMRequest::getParameter() called
  ZMRequest::getParameter(...)
- added ZMConfigGroup and a few more methods to ZMConfig
- added ZMRequest::isAdmin() to check for admin context
- allow the page value of a view to be a function rather than a view filename;
  requires change to layout files
- allow themes to override plugin view files
- added ZMCrumbtrail::clear() method
- renamed ZMPluginFilter ZMPluginHandler, renamed
  ZMPluginHandler::applyFilter(..) to ZMPluginHandler::filterResponse(..)
- fixed build process for update packages
- fixed loader isse that stopped theme classes being found; for example,
  custom MetaTags class, etc.
- fix online demo store meta tags
- added ZenMagick event 'init_done'; ZenMagick events all use 'onZM' as
  prefix, so the event resolves to a callback metod name of onZMInitDone(..)
- added if-modified-since and etag header for cache hits
- added support for plugin admin pages added dynamically to the menu system;
  see ZMPlugin::addMenuItem(...) for details
- added admin support for faster header (less code but also less
  functionallity)
- added code to allow plugins add links to the admin menu dynamically; this
  will allow plugins to have custom admin pages
- fixed a few typos in RSS classes
- added support to include plugins into core.php; plugins control this via
  ZMPlugin::getLoaderSupport()
- changed handler generation so plugins implement
  ZMPlugin::createPluginHandler() if they require a handler; this allows the
	handler to be reused by internally caching it
- add support for cart actions to zm_call_zc_page(..)
- make ZMShoppingCart use a reference of zen-cart's cart object rather than
  taking a copy; removed ZMShoppingCart::refresh()
- changed fopen call in lastRSS.php to @fopen to avoid ugly error stacks if
  behind a firewall...
- level of loader support for plugins is now depending on the configured
  loader support flag for each plugin. The flag also controlls core.php
	inclusion. Valid flags are:
	NONE   = no loader support; no core.php support
	PLUGIN = no additional loader support; plugin class will be added to
	         core.php
	ALL    = full loader support; all .php files will be included in core.php
- added basic support to add pretty link rules for custom URLs
- allow plugin admin pages to be generated as either simple contents or as
  part or a ZMPluginPage instance
	In other words, the function passed into ZMPlugin::addMenuIten(..) either
	generates simple HTML output, or no output at all but returns a ZMPluginPage
	instance containing the contents
- extract Ultimate SEO 2.x code into separate plugin
- Existing Ultimate SEO files may be removed using the install cleanup option;
  this needs to be done *before* installing the new zm_useo2 plugin
- created new plugin for Ultimate SEO 3.x support
- fixed broken attribute dropdowns on product page
- changed attribute code to ignore unsupported/unknown attribyte types rather
  than playing dead
- fixed #1739163: invalid attribute form field for text input fields
- fixed #1740306: php warning when empty search result
- fixed #1740312: advanced search - fatal php error
- use ZM_ROOT where appropriate; changing this will still require to change
  the init_templates.php override files as ZM_ROOT is not yet defined at that
  point
- disable POST handling when 'isEnableZenMagick' is false
- do not run zen-cart fixes (zc_fixes.php) if not using themes
  ('isEnableZenMagick'); this will break POST handling for some zen-cart pages
- allow category prev/next links to be secure if the page is secure
- fixed #1741055: nonssl links in order history
- added setting 'zmLogFilename', which, if set will be used to log ZenMagick log
  entries; default is null to use the default log file (usually the httpd
	error log)
- also added 'isZMErrorHandler'; if set to true and 'zmLogFilename' is set, a
  custom error handler will be used to log **all** PHP messages in the custom
  logfile
- fixed invalid variable name in whos_online.php
- fixed missing order by SQL for new products (ZMProducts)
- fixed a few cases where define(..) calls didn't quote the first parameter
- fixed invalid variable name in zm_absolute_href(..)
- fixed most PHP notice issues (that logfile thingy comes quite handy here..)
- fix wrong privacy policy checkbox name in create_account.php
- make enable/disable gender/company/dob/state options work in views (create,
  update and address) and also adjust validation accordingly
- make update account work without dob
- renamed the variable that contains the address list from $zm_addresses to
  $zm_addressList, as the name clashes with the ZMAddresses service instance;
	this requires to update address_book.php
- changed the id of the maine table in address.php from address to newaddress;
  there are corresponding changes to the CSS; the name clashes with the id of
	the address form element
- added list of selectable addresses for change shipping/biling address
- fix in ZMSession where the country was stored in the session rather than the
  countryId
- renamed ZMPageView::getTemplate() and ZMThemeInfo::getTemplateFor(..) to
  getLayout() and getLayoutFor(..), respectively

- fixed #1748910 address book pages should not be cached

  override any *default* class or controller
- fixed title for homepage, category, category_list, manufacturer and ezpages
  (ZMMetaTags)
- made view accessible from controller
- fixed a few leftover hardcoded response views from controllers
- added mapping id to ZMView
- moved ZMAjaxController::callZCPageController(..) as zm_call_zc_page into the
  misc package
- moved ZMPageView a bit, removed obsolete ZMThemeView
- added ZMPluginView to allow controller added by a plugin to serve custom
  content views from within the plugin folder
- added setting to enable/disable adding the store name to the page title

- fixed source_view view
- added example of using ZenMagick from external PHP files

Release 0.8.0
- added cookie_usage view
- added code to allow ZenMagick to actually process POST requests
- added ZMLoginController for POST handling of logins
- added new setting 'postRequestEnabledList' to allow POST request handling
  for configured pages only
- added new method isValidSession() to ZMRequest
- add password and authorization to ZMAccount and actually populate them
- added new global $zm_validator instance for central validation config (this
  will be used for server side validation, too)
- added new all-in-one ZMValidator::insertJSValidation($id) method
- added extra/valdation.php to default theme which now contains all
  validations
- modified all views that use JS validation to use the new validation code
- added new setting 'isAutoJSValidation' which is on by default; zm_form and
  zm_secure_form will automatically add JS validation code if it exists;
	this means all required is to set up validation rules and create the form
	using zm_form or zm_secure_form!
- make ZenMagick code fail gracefully *if* all patches are reverted *and* the
  zenmagick folder gets removed (I know this still leaves a trail of unused
	files, but still better than what we have now)
- added a meta tag: generator = ZenMagick [version] to the default_layout
- fixed server side validation code (has not been used until now)
- added new ZMSession class that acts as wrapper around $_SESSION in order to
  keep access to $_SESSION central and simple
- default and demo theme version now follow the main ZenMagick version number
- added ZMFieldMatchRule validation rule to validate new password and confirm
  password
- simplified the ZMMinRule setup, as name and min length are passed as
  parameter already (since we only use the min value, the format needed to be
	changed to %2$s to access the second format parameter rather than just using
	%s; please see http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.sprintf.php for more
	details)
- all regular access to $_GET and $_POST is now wrapped in zm_sanitize(..) calls
- refactored zm_db_value_list() into ZMDao::bindValueList(..)
- account subscriptions changed a bit to make the DAO more consistent - this
  required minor changes to a couple account views and controllers;
	basically ZMSubscriptions got dumped and all information moved into ZMAccount
- removed companyName from ZMAccount
- had to change email parameter handling - sorry! zen-cart values are now
  directly available under their respective names, for example 
	$INTRO_ORDER_NUMBER; zc_args does not exist any more.
- added code to handle forgotten password submits
- fix: getCompanyName() in create_account view needs to be called on
  zm_address rather than zm_account
- really fix dummy sidebox patch so no sidebox dummies are created for
  filenames including '.in.'
- renamed ZMModel::populateFromRequest() to populate($req)
- fixed some invalid settings
- changed the default message type from 'error' to 'msg'
- added forth inbuild message type 'success'
- messages now support references (ie; field names) like zen-cart does
- 'msg' and 'success' messages default to the same style in default and demo
  theme
- added zm_field_messages(..) and corresponding CSS rules to display field
  specific error messages - the demo theme login view is changed to illustrate
	thhis
- added code to ZMSession (and zm_redirect(..)) to save messages in the
  session if redirecting - this way it is transparent to the caller
- added submit handling for change account password
- fixed issue with ZMDateRule; format now defaults to UI_DATE_FORMAT if not
  set (null); this is related to the fact that i18n defines are set only
	*after* the validation rules are loaded and therefore UI_DATE_FORMAT is not
	yet available!
- added product_notification email template
- fixed DAO method bindValueList() for data types other than integer
- added a module base class ZMPlugin ('course it has to be named differently!)
- changed all code to use getDB() rather than $db_ directly
- renamed ZMDao and the dao package to ZMService and services, respectively to
  accomodate the fact that ZMDao was used in a broader sense than just DAO
- rewrite of the zco-notifier code to allow even easier subscriptions to
  zen-cart events (includes a new patch)
- added a (admittelty very basic) plugin admin page
- added ZMPluginFilter to allow plugins to modify the generated page contents
  before returning it to the client; NOTE: requires isEnableOB to be true!
- fixed/added getAmount() method to ZMOrderTotal and updated phpdoc -
  getValue() does actually return the string, not the (float) amount!
- renamed ZMOrderItem:getId() to ZMOrderItem:getProductId() as this is what it
  is; needs some changes to templates..
- renamed all desctructor methods ___desctructor, thus disabling them as they
  are currently all empty; this might break existing code as older versions do
	call parent::__desctruct()
- removed obsolete include of init.php in external.php
- added ZMUrlMapper to make response views configurable (via
  ZMController::findView(...))
- removed some .htaccess rules that do not seem to work too well with
  commercially hosted sites (missing images and CSS) ... I'll think about
	replacements once I am not so tired any more
- added console permanently to admin (rather than having it sitting in etc);
  you can always delete the file in admin if you do not want it...
- made 'isEnableOB' setting obsolete as we need that in order for plugins to
  be able to access the page content
- removed ZMCachedThemeView as this does not work with plugin page filters
- moved ZMView from the rp.uip to the rp package, ZMEmailView from 
  rp.uip.views.email to rp.uip.views;
- change ZMView::getPage() to ZMView::getName(); this requires changes to a
  couple theme files
- added new check to page cache check to disable caching of pages that contain
  messages
- ZMCurrencies does not rely on zen-carts global $currencies instance any more
- renamed ZMThemeView to ZMPageView
- make product comparison formk use GET rather than POST
- added contact_us POST handling; there is no support for the recipient
  dropdown; also, the email template will not work when using zen-cart request
	handling
- fixed ZMImageInfo and zm_absolute_href (thanks, Matt)
- went over all =& assignements to get rid of most PHP5 deprecated messages
- fixed wrong lookup of additional images (thanks again, Matt)

- FWIW there is now an option to skip the strip phase generating core.php
  which makes reading the file easier (I was curious about the file size
	difference...)
- added file changelog (added/modified/removed); this is based on the actual
  difference between release .zip files rather than CVS, so it should be
	actually useful
- added setting to control which pages get SEO treatment
- removed unused rewrite rules from .htaccess file
- added new ZMZcoObserver as global observer of some zen-cart events where
  nothing else works

- fixed broken account notification view
- fixed wrong account notification checkbox names
- another fix for multi value request parameter in zm_href(..)
- includes zmConsole.php

Release 0.7.0
- added about page
- added optional PHP console; good for debuging, but a possible security issue,
  so it's distributed in the etc directory and needs to be copied manually into
  the zen-cart admin folder
- theme code refactoring
- moved getCurrencyId(), getLanguageId() and getLanguageName() from ZMRequest to ZMRuntime
- theme info will inherit default settings
- added zm_phpinfo() function that strips some of the original formatting
- removed unneccessary echo from eval(..) calls
- renamed ZMRuntime::getApplicationRoot() to getContext()
- ZMLoader::getStatic() now guarantees that local.php is the first item if it
  exists
- locale settings are now also inherited from the default theme
- changed default templates to use ZMDateRule to validate dates - the JS
  validation is now also more strict; this also means UI_DATE_FORMAT_VALIDATION
  is obsolete :)
- refactored generic date parsing code into zm_parse_date(..)
- excluded account, write and edit pages from page cache - this is a temp.
  solutions until I can come up with some proper config for this
- fix zm_is_empty for arrays was doing the oppositve of what is expected
- added better request dispatching code to allow for multiple theme switching
  => all ZenMagick globals are instantiated before, MetaTags and Crumbtrail
  may be overwritten with theme versions; same stays true for controller
  => switching is only supported in extra code, everything else is not defined
  => the switch will be done after *all* extra code has been loaded
- fixed categories code and underline current category in sidebox
- performance: moved cache check into init.php, thus cutting out more code
- fixed broken SQL patch
- added canUndo() metod to ZMInstallatinPatch
- added better file permission checks to core.php compressor
- added language to key for page cache
- use full names in patch messages
- fix ZMProduct::getDefaultCategory()
- fix features SQL for MySQL > 5.0.24
- fix some dao SQL issues with MySQL > 5.0.24
- fix category filter
- more phpdoc along the way
- changed JS validation code so validations skip empty fields; this means
  if a field is empty you won't get a message about invalid format
- added zm_htmlencode(..) wrapper to some more fields in product_info view and
  product images (alt/title)
- added .htaccess rules to support Ultimate SEO URLs
- integrated Ultimate SEO mod (based on version 2.103) into ZenMagick; this can
  be used as an alternative to ZenMagick's pretty links;
  There is also a new patch to enable/disable SEO - additional benefit,
  as there are no version specific zen-cart files required!
  SEO installer SQL has been updated and tested with MySQL 5.0.27
- added zen_href_link replacement that allows pretty links to work for
  redirects as well
- added dependsOn() method to installation patches
- added still missing product_reviews view
- the setting 'isEnableThemeDefaults' now controlls all aspects of theme
  defaults; this includes views, boxes, classes and l10n/i18n
- all default views now use zm_format_address(..) to format addresses
- reworked locale (l10n/i18n) handling, so using define(..) isn't a
  problem; this also means to split the theme loading from the request
  handling (which is actually good!) to be able to do theme loading during
  the init phase - otherwise zen-cart will have used up all the good defines :)
  This slightly changes the syntax in l10n and i18n files and breaks older
  themes. Advantage is that theme values are stored as variables and only
  once the final theme is determined are converted into defines thus allowing
  proper overwriting of values during theme switching and for fallback to
  default theme settings
  THIS BREAKS OLDER THEME LOCALE CODE
- fixed merge option in language tool work and added include default theme
  option
- added .htaccess files to restrict access to ZenMagick installation files
- extracted page caching strategy into separate function (default); THe
  strategy can be changed by configuring an alternative function by setting
  'pageCacheStrategyCallback'; signature is bool callback()
- modified l10n.php and i18n.php in demo theme to illustrate the changes in
  locale handling;
- most patches now know how to undo
- changed patch so no sidebox dummies are created for filenames including '.in.'

  available or disabled

  view object
- changed the default rss cache dir to be in line with the page cache settings
- included PEAR:Cache_Lite to distribution as cache driver
- performance: logging is now disabled in the default configuration

  permissions do not allow to add the ZenMagick menu, or under ZenMagick

  more

  value is the old value or null

  deprecated - this might eventually disappear altogether...
- added getDefaultCategory() to ZMProduct; this will return either the master
  category or the first mapped category for the product
- fixed invalid db code in ZMProducts.php

- fixed lots of regressions; in particular broken validations, SQL errors and
  product listings

- partly stripped ZMModel as the new validation code makes this obsolete (the
  implementation code will stay around until I find time to rewrite the update
  stuff)
- renamed rss and wordpress sideboxes to rss.in.php and wordpress.in.php,
  respectively. People using them should rename them in order to avoid
  overwriting them with the next update

- Fixed bug when payments do not have confirmation fields
- Excluding controller classes from being loaded on init - they (and possibly
  more) are loaded using the loader

  have their own layout and CSS
- fixed invalid HTML in payments page plus missing checkbox for gv redemption

  etc)
- make JavaScript submitFunction(..) on payments page work as expected; if gv
  reedemption value >= total, payment type is not mandatory any more
- Most classes now extend from ZMObject which is a generic base class
