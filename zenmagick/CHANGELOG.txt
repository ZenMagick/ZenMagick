Release 0.6.2:

  overwrite existing files any more!

  permissions do not allow to add the ZenMagick menu, or under ZenMagick
- return error view when ez page not found; same for product page and a few
  more

  value is the old value or null
- added getDefaultCategory() to ZMProduct; this will return either the master
  category or the first mapped category for the product

  product listings

  implementation code will stay around until I find time to rewrite the update
  stuff)

  overwriting them with the next update

  generic class loading (exludes controller and model so far)
