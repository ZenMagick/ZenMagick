This directory contains all the stuff that didn't find a place anywhere else.

* sql
  The sql directory contains all the SQL that ZenMagick needs for it's unique featres.

* zmConsole.php
  This is a simple form based console that you can drop into the zen-cart admin directory.
  Once there, it will show up as item under the ZenMagick menu.
  It allows to run arbitrary PHP code. That is also the reson why it isn't included as a
  default as I don't want to be held responsible for any damange done with it :)
  Sill, it's useful for debugging and analysis, so you may either use it or delete it.
