missing zen-cart stuff
======================

- implement missing weight and onetime prices for attributes
- support more zen-cart options/features - do we?
- product_free_shipping_info and a couple more are still missing
- can't checkout rope product
- file attribute


usablility / quality / performance / etc
========================================

bugs:
- fix default theme IE bugs; test in IE7
- popup content should be in define/ez pages or such...
- do not create sidebox dummies for filenames including '.in.'
- file permissions for created files???
- long text like EMAIL_ADVISORY, popup contents needs to be put somewhere...
- rely less on zen-cart defines as they might not be available during init...
- make filter/sorter look nicer and easier to configure (autodetect??)
- make price filter actually work

admin/install:
- admin interface for ZM config values
- generic interface to manage theme settings
- features: error handling, form validation
- language support for ZenMagick admin area
- implement merge option for language mapping tool
- framework?
- reorganize admin_init (started)

structure:
- store settings somewhere?
- have separate wrapper around store settings (eg. name, etc)
- zmboxconfig; admin/theme support? get it working at all
- restructure to have zenmagick outside htdocs?
- use reflection to populate model classes from request?
- APIs for other apps; for example WordPress, etc...
- add global extra folder; move local.php to there; themes can actually have local.php too!
- l10n for module (eg payments) messages...
- improve ZMClassLoader to resolve dependencies (use get_parent_class(..) or better 
  get_class_hierachy(..) for PHP4 comp.)
- db: config values, sidebox config
- random query in ZMProducts = more generic db interface ? how to integrate with zen-cart?
- get proper random query (mostly products)
- db: recovery when integrating external code (wordpress, etc) that change the db! (x-ref to APIs for other apps)
- not sure about the product specials SQL...

general:
- get a logo and favicon
- clean up zen-bridge
- val rules:min -> minlength, also maxlength, range
- zm_create() as shortcut for $zm_loader->create()...
- get rid of core/misc/validations.php
- look into using/supporting gettext
- more documentation
- more phpdoc

performance:
- improve :)
- redo zm_find_includes, _zm_build_href, zm_get_instance, 



Module notes
============
=> implement DPS as showcase
=> ZMModule => ZMPaymentModule, ZMShippingModule, ZMOrderTotalModule
=> shared attr. like enabled/disabled, zone for shipping modules, etc + getter setter for order, etc...
=> could be distributed as extra functions/classes to work with zc
