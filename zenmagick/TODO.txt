missing zen-cart stuff
======================
- implement missing weight and onetime prices for attributes
- product_free_shipping_info and a couple more are still missing
- file attribute


usablility / quality / performance / etc
========================================
bugs:
- make filter/sorter look nicer and easier to configure (autodetect??)
- make price filter actually work

.admin/install:
- admin interface for ZM config values
- generic interface to manage theme settings
- sidebox patches and plugins work relative to the current theme only - should they update all themes?

structure:
- store settings somewhere?
- have separate wrapper around store settings (eg. name, etc)
- restructure to have zenmagick outside htdocs?
- use reflection to populate model classes from request?

general:
- get a logo and favicon
- get rid of wrapped zen-cart data (like orders, shopping cart, etc)

performance:
- improve :)
