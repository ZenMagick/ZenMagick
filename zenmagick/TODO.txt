zen-cart:
- implement missing weight and onetime prices for attributes

- product popups; do we?


usablility:
- add category (no products) controller/view
- fix default theme IE bugs
- admin interface for ZM config values
- SQL import that can prepend the ZM_DB_PREFIX
- more documentation
- regexp style fields for generating various image names; eg:
  small = /images/products/$model_T.JPG
  medium = /images/products/$model.JPG
  large = /images/products/$model_L.JPG
- generic interface to manage theme settings

code quality:
- improve ZMClassLoader to resolve dependencies
- improve class loader to load only actually required files; what about functions?
- Proper use of references (ie usage of & when passing objects around)
- ZMView -> ZMForwardView, ZMRedirectView + ZMView as base class
- refactor SQL to generic sql layer? overkill? ... but still fun?
- restructure to have zenmagick outside htdocs
- admin:features: error handling, form validation
- more phpdoc
- use bind on $db for all SQL


new features:
- custom filter per theme?
- external API; application_top + init?
