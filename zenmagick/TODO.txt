missing zen-cart stuff
======================

- implement missing weight and onetime prices for attributes
- support more zen-cart options/features
- category filter (get default category)
- gv send is broken
- downloadable stuff...
- product_free_shipping_info and a couple more are still missing
- can't checkout rope product
- file attribute
- shipping calculator



usablility / quality / performance / etc
========================================

bugs:
- fix default theme IE bugs; test in IE7
- popup content should be in define/ez pages or such...
- load local first, check if array exists ni both places (before loading local and when loading settings - should work for db-prefix?
  (not really a bug, but proper prefix detection to avoid errors)
- do not create sidebox dummies for filenames including '.in.'

admin/install:
- admin interface for ZM config values
- generic interface to manage theme settings
- features: error handling, form validation
- language support for ZenMagick admin area
- error message if file permissions missing
- proper installation routine
- fallback menu if no permissions
- implement merge option for language mapping tool
- framework?

structure:
- store settings somewhere?
- have separate wrapper around store settings (eg. name, etc)
- zmboxconfig; admin/theme support? get it working at all
- restructure to have zenmagick outside htdocs?
- reorganize theme code; ZMTheme should delegate to ZMThemes, or ZMThemes plus ZMTheme
- create empty c'tors for all model classes and use loader in dao; them exclude from loading
- use reflection to populate model classes from request?
- proper class hierachy - dao, model, business (mostly there, me thinks - business is perhaps only required
  if doing updates, etc)
- APIs for other apps; for example WordPress, etc...
- modules base class?

general:
- more validations plus separate validation rules from views/templates; 
  this could be a big file containing all validations that gets included once 
  (or include_once per form); each form imports JS and creates rules as required
- new lighter theme for zm? rounded corners of sideboxes?
- misc package? leave only bootstrap in core?
- Proper use of references (ie usage of ampersand (&amp;) when passing objects around) (mostly done, I think)
- compare for null needs ===
- test all class changes in PHP5
- get a logo and favicon
- add code that if required fails, other rules are skipped - add property 
  to tell validator that - ah need the JS as well!!!

db:
- config values, sidebox config
- random query in ZMProducts = more generic db interface ? how to integrate with zen-cart?
- get proper random query (mostly products)
- recovery when integrating external code (wordpress, etc) that change the db! (x-ref to APIs for other apps)
- new max results handling (in particular products) - urgent! (this is done, right?)
- use 3rd party API for db access??
- not sure about the specials SQL...

(class) loading:
- improve ZMClassLoader to resolve dependencies
- improve class loader to load only actually required files; what about functions?
- remove theme controller path from loader
- conditional class loading - we do not need everything all the time?
  * use loader to get instances - it can load on demand
  * how do we know what to load?
  * lowercase is code - always
  * currently controller are all loaded
  * do not need model - dao's can use loader
  * we do need core + dao, everything else could be loader?
  * var-args for zm_get_instance?
  * theme code must use loader ?
- more sophisticated controller matching to request URLs (mainly main_page)



documentation
=============

- more documentation
- more phpdoc
- sorting, filtering
- add version to apidocs (somehow)
- install instructions: until 1.0 remove core directory before upgrade
- disable 'skip single product categories' - otherwise the view can't be resolved properly...
- basic CSS id/class system in default theme


stuff
=====


- Options Followsymlinks ??
- iheritence problem with custom code when base classes are not yet loaded!
- is this where we need convention that upper case is class and needs to be created using loader???
- demo defautl controller:
        // normal processing
        $view =& parent::processGet();
return $view!!
- for optional overwrites we need to load code before app-top!
- zm_create() as shortcut for $zm_loader->create()...

- view/template cache ??? view->getResponse(); view can delegate to cache if configured,ob_start()

- remove inherit from default template extra code as there isn't! also to complicated....
bad enough with theme handling...
themeconfig extend each other as well!!

RewriteBase takes only one param!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- val rules:min -> minlength, also maxlength, range

- loading reloaded:
=> class loader rename loader - loads classes **and** code
=> mk independant from any globals,
=> bootstrap should be bootstrap, loader and the the loader does the rest...
=> loader hirachy to reflect theme code? parent first, etc...

themes:
* themeconfig:
  - theme specific config

* theme
   theme code plus ref to theme config
   => getThemeConfig()
   => all the stuff views/templates are doing right now

* runtime
  - knows the configured theme,
     => getThemeId
     => getTHeme
     ** the rest is job of theme!!


- reorganize admin_init
- put some usefult stuff into local.in.php
- ZMaddress: populate with default store country:         $this->country_ = $zm_countries->getCountryForId($zm_request->getRequestParameter('country', zm_setting('storeCountry')));
- replace all require, etc with zm_resolve_zc_class()
- shipping calculator
- module framework?
=> implement DPS as showcase
=> ZMModule => ZMpaymentModule, ZMShippingModule, ZMOrderTotalModule
=> shared attr. like enabled/disabled, zone for shipping modules, etc + getter setter for order, etc...
=> could be distributed as extra functions/classes to work with zc
- http://faq.1and1.com/scripting_languages_supported/configuring_apache_server_using_htaccess/4.html
- real SEO: wrapper class that converts:
-> a given href to something useful: ie/category names rather than numbers...
-> does the reverse without to much overhead...


- shipping display: check error -> still displaying as option if error!
                    <tr><td colspan="3"><strong><?php echo $provider->getName() ?></strong><?php if ($provider->hasError()) { zm_l10n("(%s)", $provider->getError()); } ?></td></tr>
                        <?php if ($provider->hasError()) { continue; } foreach ($provider->getShippingMethods() as $method) { $id = 'ship_'.$method->getId();?>
do not display at all??
- references & in shipping / cart where zc stuff gets passed around?
- l10n for module messages...
- use zm_format_address(..) everywhere?
- get rid of popup prefix (filename)
