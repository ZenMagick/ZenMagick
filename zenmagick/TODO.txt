zen-cart:
- implement missing weight and onetime prices for attributes
- support more zen-cart options/features
- category filter (get default category)
- gv send is broken
- downloadable stuff...
- product_free_shipping_info and a couple more are still missing
- can't checkout rope product
- file attribute
- shipping calculator


usablility:
- fix default theme IE bugs; test in IE7
- admin interface for ZM config values
- more documentation
- generic interface to manage theme settings
- sefu/seo support
- store settings somewhere?
- have separate wrapper around store settings (eg. name, etc)
- zmboxconfig; admin/theme support? get it working at all
- zm_form: convert action query params to hidden fields
- more validations plus separate validation rules from views/templates; this could be a big file containing all validations that gets included once (or include_once per form); each form imports JS and creates rules as required
- new lighter theme for zm? rounded corners of sideboxes?
- misc package? leave only bootstrap in core?
- popup content should be in define/ez pages or such...

db:
- config values, sidebox config

code quality:
- improve ZMClassLoader to resolve dependencies
- improve class loader to load only actually required files; what about functions?
- Proper use of references (ie usage of ampersand (&amp;) when passing objects around)
- restructure to have zenmagick outside htdocs
- admin:features: error handling, form validation
- more phpdoc
- random query in ZMProducts
- optional fallback of category navigation as with current zen-cart
- remove theme controller path from loader
- replicate useful init stuff from zen-cart
- get proper random query (mostly products)
- compare for null needs ===
- reorganize theme code; ZMTheme should delegate to ZMThemes, or ZMThemes plus ZMTheme
- rework default theme result list handling
- get rid of ZenMagick db package
- random select!!
- new max results handling (in particular products) - urgent!
- use 3rd party API for db access
- language support for ZenMagick admin area
- error message if file permissions missing
- fallback menu if no permissions
- proper installation routine
- rename zmcontroller zmbasecontroller?
- uniform class prefix for base classes? zmbasefilter, zbbasesort(er)
- conditional class loading - we do not need everything all the time?
  * use loader to get instances - it can load on demand
  * how do we know what to load?
  * lowercase is code - always
  * currently controller are all loaded
  * do not need model -> dao's can use loader
  * we do need core & dao, everything else could be loader?
  * var-args for zm_get_instance?
  * theme code must use loader ?
- load local first, check if array exists ni both places (before loading local and when loading settings - should work for db-prefix?
- not sure about the specials SQL...
- create empty c'tors for all model classes and use loader in dao; them exclude from loading
- use reflection to populate model classes from request?
- more sophisticated controller matching ti request URLs (mainly main_page)
- test all class changes in PHP5

proper class hierachy
=> dao, model, business


new features:
- custom filter per theme?
- APIs for other apps; for example WordPress, etc...
- get a logo and favicon
- controller to configure sort options based on theme settings; this 
- add code that if required fails, other rules are skipped - add property 
  to tell validator that - ah need the JS as well!!!


docs:
- sorting, filtering
- add version to apidocs (somehow)
- install instructions: until 1.0 remove core directory before upgrade
- disable 'skip single product categories' -> otherwise the view can't be resolved properly...


admin:
- implement merge option for language mapping tool


ZenMagick admin:
- framework
- different structure
- nicer
- extendable
- modify
- modules
- MVC
- include install
- cleanup obsolete files?
