missing zen-cart stuff
======================
- implement missing weight and onetime prices for attributes
- product_free_shipping_info and a couple more are still missing
- file attribute


usablility / quality / performance / etc
========================================
bugs:
- make filter/sorter look nicer and easier to configure (autodetect??)
- make price filter actually work

.admin/install:
- admin interface for ZM config values
- generic interface to manage theme settings
- sidebox patches and plugins work relative to the current theme only - should they update all themes?

structure:
- store settings somewhere?
- have separate wrapper around store settings (eg. name, etc)
- restructure to have zenmagick outside htdocs?
- use reflection to populate model classes from request?
- improve ZMClassLoader to resolve dependencies (use get_parent_class(..) or better 
  get_class_hierachy(..) for PHP4 comp.)
- review handling of global exports (too many places and not consistent...)

general:
- get a logo and favicon
- clean up zen-bridge
- get rid of wrapped zen-cart data (like orders, shopping cart, etc)

performance:
- improve :)


Module notes
============
=> implement DPS as showcase
=> ZMModule => ZMPaymentModule, ZMShippingModule, ZMOrderTotalModule
=> shared attr. like enabled/disabled, zone for shipping modules, etc + getter setter for order, etc...
=> could be distributed as extra functions/classes to work with zc

features notes
==============
feature_group: group_id, desc, bla
feature_group_mapping: group_id, feature_id
product_feature_group: map groups to features

default values for features
