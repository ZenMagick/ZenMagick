zen-cart:
- implement missing weight and onetime prices for attributes
- support more zen-cart options/features
- 22 pages (or less :) missing!


usablility:
- fix default theme IE bugs; test in IE7
- admin interface for ZM config values
- more documentation
- generic interface to manage theme settings
- sefu/seo support
- store settings somewhere?
- have separate wrapper around store settings (eg. name, etc)


code quality:
- improve ZMClassLoader to resolve dependencies
- improve class loader to load only actually required files; what about functions?
- Proper use of references (ie usage of ampersand (&amp;) when passing objects around)
- ZMView -> ZMForwardView, ZMRedirectView + ZMView as base class
- refactor SQL to generic sql layer? overkill? ... but still fun?
- restructure to have zenmagick outside htdocs
- admin:features: error handling, form validation
- more phpdoc
- random query in ZMProducts
- optional fallback of category navigation as with current zen-cart
- remove theme controller path from loader
- replicate useful init stuff from zen-cart
- get proper random query (mostly products)
- compare for null needs ===
- reorganize theme code; ZMTheme should delegate to ZMThemes, or ZMThemes plus ZMTheme
- rework default theme result list handling
- get rid of ZenMagick db package
- random select!!
- new max results handling (in particular products) - urgent!
- rethink sorting
- what are filters, again?
- extends ZMSort to allow ZMSortOptions to collect available options based on found sort classes
  similar to filters
- use 3rd party API for db access
- language support for ZenMagick admin area
- file write check for dummy sidebox create
- error message if file permissions missing
- fallback menu if no permissions

proper class hierachy
=> dao, model, business


new features:
- custom filter per theme?
- APIs for other apps; for example WordPress, etc...
- get a logo and favicon


docs:
- sorting, filtering
- add version to apidocs (somehow)


admin:
- implement merge option for language mapping tool
- handle redirect in CMP
- create dummy CMPs
- disable all but features


ZenMagick admin:
- framework
- different structure
- nicer
- extendable
- modify
- modules
- MVC
- include install
- cleanup obsolete files?
