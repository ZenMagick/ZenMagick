ZenMagick
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ZenMagick/ZenMagick.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ZenMagick/ZenMagick)

A reliable, flexible Open Source e-commerce solution for internet retailers of all trades.

Originally based on [Zen Cart](http://www.zen-cart.com/), it has evolved into a flexible and robust system of its own, that allows you to get the shopping cart you want.

Overview
--------
Despite the fact that ZenMagick has a history of evolution, all ZenMagick code has been written from scratch. The result is a flexible, reliable architecture that is the foundation of ZenMagick e-commerce. Current development aims to use and integrate existing proven PHP libraries such as [doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/).
