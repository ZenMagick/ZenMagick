ZenMagick
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ZenMagick/ZenMagick.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ZenMagick/ZenMagick)

A reliable, flexible Open Source e-commerce solution for internet retailers of all trades.

Originally based on [Zen Cart](http://www.zen-cart.com/), it has evolved into a flexible and robust system of its own, that allows you to get the shopping cart you want.

Overview
--------
Despite the fact that ZenMagick has a history of evolution, all ZenMagick code has been written from scratch. The result is a flexible, reliable architecture
that is the foundation of ZenMagick e-commerce.
Current development aims to use and integrate existing proven PHP libraries such as [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) and [doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/).

ZenMagick includes almost all things provided by Zen Cart plus an increasing number of unique features.
