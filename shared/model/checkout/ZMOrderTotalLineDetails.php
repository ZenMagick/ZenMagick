/**
 * Order total line details as returned by a plugin implementing the <code>ZMOrderTotal</code>

 * <p>The <em>title</em> and <em>amount</em> are the minimum requirements for an order
 * total. Other available properties are optional.</p>
 *
 * <p>Order totals are not supposed to calculate tax on their own. Instead, each calculated detail includes a
 * corresponding tax class id. That way tax can be calculated later on the subtotals for each tax class to avoid
 * rounding errors. The <em>tax</em>, <em>subtotal</em> and <em>total</em> order totals are responsible for
 * handling all of that.</p>
 *
 * <p>The default value for the tax class id is <em>0</em> for no tax.</p>
